# Task Manager 

A simple and elegant Task Manager built with **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**.  
It helps you stay productive using the Pomodoro technique.

---

## Features

- Add, complete, and delete tasks
- Visual separation of To-Do and Completed tasks
- Pomodoro-style timer for each task (25 minutes by default)


---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **React** – Component-based front-end
- **TypeScript** – Type-safe code
- **Tailwind CSS** – Utility-first styling
- **Vite** – Super-fast build tool

---

## 🧠 Motivation

I built this project to practice clean component architecture and learn how to integrate timers and task management logic into a front-end interface.  
Future versions may include persistent storage, user auth, and more advanced features.
